# 🎭 Voice Nickname Bot - Transform Your Discord Experience

## Automatic Identity Magic for Voice Channels

Transform your Discord server into an immersive experience where users get mysterious new identities the moment they join voice channels. Whether you're running a gaming community, roleplay server, or just want to add some fun anonymity to voice chats, this bot creates instant intrigue.

## ✨ What Makes It Special

**Instant Transformation** - The moment someone joins a voice channel, they're assigned a random nickname like "Subject 042" or "Operator 156". When they leave, their original name is perfectly restored.
